# Leaf_diesease-Detection

## Problem Statement:
The proposed solution worked by analysing the images of the plantsâ€™ leaves in a manner similar to how our brain works ( in simple outlined way), by segregating the problem statement into smaller and smaller problems and then extracting value from the machine learning models trained over large image dataset of various infected leaves to get the final disease the plant is affected with.
Future work for the project involved incorporating the models with android systems using tensorflow lite and using suitable web scraping to provide the user with a proper solution (medicines and others) so as to cure the plant/


## Algorithms used:
* ***For leaf prediction***:	
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Otsu Binarisation
  - Haralick Feature Extraction
  - Grid Search for optimising the prediction model
* ***For Disease detection***:
  - Segregation
  - Oversampling
  - Extensively trained Convolution Neural Networks


## Future Work included:
* Using Generative Adversarial Networks for oversampling
* Neural Networks for Leaf Prediction
* Transfer Learning
* Hybrid Neural Networks, like CNN + LSTM,  for disease detection
